    Don't let the strong taste of fennel scare you: it fades down after
    cooking. This is a rich and creamy risotto, just like it ought to be! You
    can use chicken stock in place of the vegetable stock, as well as olive
    oil for the butter.

      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups uncooked Arborio rice</li>
      <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

    <h3 class="steps-h3">Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the base off of the fennel bulbs, and cut a cone shape into the
        base to remove the core. Slice the fennel vertically (lengthwise) into
        1/4 inch thick slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Cook
        onions and fennel in butter for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice; cook for
        another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Stir in
        1 cup vegetable broth; continue stirring until liquid is almost
        completely absorbed. Repeat this process with remaining broth,
        stirring constantly. Incorporating the broth should take 15 to 20
        minutes in all.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in cream, 3 tablespoons Parmesan and parsley, and cook until rice
        is done and risotto is thick and creamy. Season to taste with black
        pepper. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, and sprinkle with remaining
        cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
