        A delicious pepper steak recipe served with boiled white rice — easy and made from items I've already got in my
        cupboards. My mother clipped this recipe from somewhere and it became a specialty of mine; however, I've been
        unable to find the original source.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Slice steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the
                mixture is smooth. Place steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook steak strips
                in batches in hot oil so as not to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes, and
                remove steak from the wok to a bowl. Repeat with remaining steak, adding more oil as needed, and set the
                cooked meat aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak and onion together until onion
                begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in green pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook and stir the mixture until peppers have turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2
                minutes more, then add tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
