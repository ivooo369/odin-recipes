      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti pasta until al
          dente. Drain well. Toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile in a large skillet, cook chopped bacon until slightly crisp;
          remove and drain onto paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon
          fat; add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and heat in reused large
          skillet. Add chopped onion, and cook over medium heat until onion is
          translucent. Add minced garlic, and cook 1 minute more. Add wine if
          desired; cook one more minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return cooked bacon to pan; add cooked and drained spaghetti. Toss to
          coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or is
          sticking together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with
          tongs or large fork until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup
          Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Add salt and pepper to taste
          (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately with chopped parsley sprinkled on top, and extra
          Parmesan cheese at table.
        </li>
      </ol>
